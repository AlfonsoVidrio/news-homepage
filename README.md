## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learned to style with Tailwind and to create my own utilities to add colors that are not natively available in Tailwind.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on creating more complex designs using Tailwind and CSS with the BEM methodology. Additionally, I want to learn how to use Redux for my upcoming React projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This resource provided me with a guide on how to write Tailwind utilities effectively.
